# **Welcome to the Yodassistant readme!**<br/>
### Here you will find descriptions regarding the project itself and all the cool things you can do with it, and also instructions on how to install it.

## THE PROJECT
Team Yodassistant is a group of four people - Nerya (Nehr yah), Ido (ee dough), Dolev, and Ariel. We are a group of friends that decided to join the Timathon, in hopes of creating the world's most Yoda-like virtual assistant. We primarily used JavaScript and Python to code the project (also ElectronJS).
We believe that Yodassistant delivers on that front, by not only using a chatbot to communicate with the user as Yoda himself, but also we added incredibly realistic drawings of him, so that you can feel as if Yoda actually is right in front of you!


## THE USES
Yodassistant provides many uses, detailed as such (in squiggly braces is what you want to ask Yoda for):
"Open {app}" - Opens any app you want. Also works with "Launch {app}".<br/>
"Increase volume" - Increases the volume by 10%.<br/>
"Decrease volume" - Decreases the volume by 10%.<br/>
"Set volume to {number}" - Sets your computer's volume to the required amount.<br/>
"Search for {query}" - Opens Google and searches it for your query.<br/>
"Tell me {question}" - Searches for an answer to the given question and answers inside the app.<br/>
"Give me a random quote" - Tells you an original random Yoda quote (also works with "Quote by Yoda").<br/>
"What time is it?" - Tells you the current time (note: works with any phrase containing "What's" and "time").<br/>
"What date is it" - Tells you the current date (note: works with any phrase containing "What's" and "date").<br/>
"How much is {math question}" - Solves an arithmetic question.<br/>
"Shut down" - Shuts your computer down (WARNING - don't say this if you have unsaved files).<br/>
"restart" - Restarts your computer (WARNING - don't say this if you have unsaved files).<br/>

CHATTING
In addition to being an extremely helpful virtual assistant, Yodassistant also allows the user to chat with them (as they would with a normal assistant). Just say anything that isn't one of the aforementioned commands, and you'll see Yoda use a powerful ChatBot AI in order to speak back!

DOWNLOADING
In order to download Yodassistant, go to the following link - https://neryasheetrit.itch.io/yodassistant.
From there, you'll download a .zip file, which you can either extract or not. For multiple uses, extraction is best since it offers the ability to save as to not have to go through the initialization process every time.
To open Yodassistant, you must open the file named "yoda.exe"
Regarding the initialization process, please allow some time for the app to start.
